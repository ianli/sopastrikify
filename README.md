SOPAStrikify
============

This is a Javascript utility to blackout websites on January 18, 2012 from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST. During that time, this utility will overlay the web page at http://sopastrike.com/strike/ on the current web page. 

This code works differently from the code provided by http://sopastrike.com, which _redirects_ the user to http://sopastrike.com/strike/. Instead, this code creates an IFrame that overlaps the whole web page, so that the original web page is obscured.

I made this for my own web sites, but I hope others would also find it useful.
